                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering design principles, the interface of Amazon shopping cart is simple, and the operation is simple, allowing users to operate it intuitively without learning. So, I think that he "most successful" would likely be Amazon shopping cart due to its seamless integration, robust functionality, and alignment with user expectations in an e-commerce environment. 
                    However, the "worst" among them is subjective and depends on specific user needs and preferences. For example, someone who values simplicity might prefer Google bookmarks, while a frequent YouTube user might prioritize the customization options of YouTube's video list despite its navigation challenges. Therefore, the determination of the "worst" design depends on individual user context and priorities.

            <li>
                <h4>Features that I plan to implement</h4>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that Google bookmarks follows the design principle of simplicity. Its interface is clean and simple, focusing on the core functionality of bookmarking web pages without unnecessary clutter. Furthermore, in YouTube, as the number of videos in the playlist increases, browsing them can become challenging. 
                    For my design, I hope that simplicity can be integrated into the interface I design, so that the page can display the content aggregated by users concisely and clearly. In addition, in my development, I hope that I can display the user's search content through the filtering function, thereby improving usage efficiency.
